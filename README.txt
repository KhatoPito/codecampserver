To build and run this project, execute "click to build.bat". 
 You must have the .Net Framework 3.5 and SQL Express (TcpIp,MixedMode enabled) installed.
 This build runs against the Asp.Net MVC RC1.  If you have the Mvc Beta installed you will need to unistall that to prevent name collisions with the GAC'ed version of the System.Web.Mvc assembly.

The solution works in Visual Studio 2008.
